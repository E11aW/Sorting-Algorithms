# Sorting-Algorithms
 Implementation of a variety of sorting algorithms in C++

This code includes the main sorting algorithms in C++ all included in the sorts.h header file. The added on sorter_tests.bat file can be used to test and compare the run times of each sorting algorithm to each other to compare efficiency of each of them.
